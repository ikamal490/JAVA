Interfaces in english ia a point where two Systems meet and interact
In java interface is a group of related methods with empty bodies.
In Java, an interface is a reference type that defines a set of methods that a class must implement.

An Example
interface Bicycle{
    void applyBrake(int decrement);
    void speedUp(int increment);
}

class AvonCycle implement Bicycle{   // implement is use in interface while extends is use in inheritance
        int speed = 7;
        void applyBrake(int decrement){
            speed = speed-decrement;
        }
        void speedUp(int increment){
            speed = speed+increment;
        }
}

Key Point of Interface:
    Cannot have instance variables or constructors.
    All methods are abstract (except default and static methods).
    All fields are public, static, and final.
    A class can implement multiple interfaces, allowing for multiple inheritance.

Abstract Classes:
    Can have instance variables and constructors.
    Can provide both complete and partial method implementations.
    Supports single inheritance (a class can extend only one abstract class).
